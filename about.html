            <h3>Andrea</h3>
            <p>Writer, librarian, and certified overthinker, Andrea is fueled by iced coffee, hyperfixations, and a deep love for psychological deep-dives and pop culture analysis. A sharp social critic with a knack for spotting patterns, she can be found devouring the latest research on human behavior or getting unnecessarily competitive over chess and crossword puzzles. ADHD champion, chaos curator, and your go-to source for unsolicited fun facts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bio">
            <h3>Lily</h3>
            <p>Brutally honest and unapologetically herself, Lily is the kind of friend everyone <em>wishes</em> they had—the one who isn’t afraid to call out bullshit and stand up for what’s right. A fierce advocate for those she loves, she pairs her strong convictions with an insatiable curiosity about, well, <em>everything</em>. Whether she’s deep in a philosophy debate, mastering a new skill just because she can, or working harder than anyone else in the room, Lily brings passion, wisdom, and a healthy dose of chaos to the mix.</p>
